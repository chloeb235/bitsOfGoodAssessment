    <p class="card-text">Hi! My name is Chloe, and I am a second-year Computational Media major at Georgia Tech! I am
      from Johns Creek,
      Georgia, which is about a 30-minute drive north of Atlanta. In high school, I earned the Silver Presidential
      Volunteer Service Award for devoting over 170 hours of service to the community during my senior year by writing
      letters to elderly homes, hosting recycling drives, and preparing meals for those in need with Meals By Grace!
      Since then, I have sought ways to serve the community in college by contributing to clothing and supply drives,
      writing for the student magazine ERATO, and assisting my peers through courses and projects wherever they need
      help.</p>
